The European Journalism Center has put together a new kick-ass resource for data journalists at [DataJournalism.com](https://datajournalism.com). It was a great honor to get to contribute an article to the growing list of resources.

There is a lot of useful content on the site and I would definitely recommend signing up for the newsletter.
